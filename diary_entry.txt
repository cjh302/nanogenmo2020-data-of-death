<h2>DATE</h2>
Dear Diary,
<p>
Today is <span class="number">DATE</span>, and there are <span class="number">CASECOUNT</span> new cases of COVID. I have been counting for <span class="number">DAYCOUNT</span> days and I am feeling <span class="set_intensity">FEELING</span>. If today's count is <span class="number">CASECOUNT</span>, what will tomorrow bring? How can we survive this? What will I see in the news, if I live to the morrow?
<p>
How many will die, of the <span class="number">CASECOUNT</span> people who got COVID today? How many will give COVID to others, and to how many others?
<p>
If I tell my friends that <span class="number">CASECOUNT</span> more people got COVID today, will they go out less? Will they wear a mask? Will they lie awake, staring at their ceiling?
<p>
How many hours of sleep are lost? How many days of work? How many dollars, or pounds, or euros? How many lives are lost and how many hearts break? Who sits alone in the silence? Who sheds tears and who feels an eternal nothing, a closing down not of their own volition?
<p>
When do we stop, Diary? Where does this lead us?
<p>
When will I stop?
<p>
A soulless summary:
<ul><li>Today: <span class="number">DATE</span>, another day.
<li>It is day number <span class="number">DAYCOUNT</span> of this <span class="set_intensity">ZEITGEIST</span>.
<li>The number of cases is <span class="number">CASECOUNT</span>.
<li>I am <span class="set_intensity">FEELING</span>.</ul>
I can neither list nor count the rest. No one can.
