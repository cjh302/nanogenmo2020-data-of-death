Dear Diary,
<p>
Today is 22 January 2020, and there are 555 new cases of COVID. I have been counting for 1 day and I am feeling confused. If today's count is 555, what will tomorrow bring? How can we survive this? What will I see in the news, if I live to the morrow?
<p>
How many will die, of the 555 people who got COVID today? How many will give COVID to others, and to how many others?
<p>
If I tell my friends that 555 more people got COVID today, will they go out less? Will they wear a mask? Will they lie awake, staring at their ceiling?
<p>
How many hours of sleep are lost? How many days of work? How many dollars, or pounds, or euros? How many lives are lost and how many hearts break? Who sits alone in the silence? Who sheds tears and who feels an eternal nothing, a closing down not of their own volition?
<p>
When do we stop, Diary? Where does this lead us?
<p>
When will I stop?

Dear Diary,
<p>
Today is 04 March 2020, and there are 95,276 new cases of COVID. I have been counting for 43 days and I am feeling confused. If today's count is 95,276, what will tomorrow bring? How can we survive this? What will I see in the news, if I live to the morrow?
<p>
How many will die, of the 95,276 people who got COVID today? How many will give COVID to others, and to how many others?
<p>
If I tell my friends that 95,276 more people got COVID today, will they go out less? Will they wear a mask? Will they lie awake, staring at their ceiling?
<p>
How many hours of sleep are lost? How many days of work? How many dollars, or pounds, or euros? How many lives are lost and how many hearts break? Who sits alone in the silence? Who sheds tears and who feels an eternal nothing, a closing down not of their own volition?
<p>
When do we stop, Diary? Where does this lead us?
<p>
When will I stop?

Dear Diary,
<p>
Today is 25 March 2020, and there are 479,279 new cases of COVID. I have been counting for 64 days and I am feeling done. If today's count is 479,279, what will tomorrow bring? How can we survive this? What will I see in the news, if I live to the morrow?
<p>
How many will die, of the 479,279 people who got COVID today? How many will give COVID to others, and to how many others?
<p>
If I tell my friends that 479,279 more people got COVID today, will they go out less? Will they wear a mask? Will they lie awake, staring at their ceiling?
<p>
How many hours of sleep are lost? How many days of work? How many dollars, or pounds, or euros? How many lives are lost and how many hearts break? Who sits alone in the silence? Who sheds tears and who feels an eternal nothing, a closing down not of their own volition?
<p>
When do we stop, Diary? Where does this lead us?
<p>
When will I stop?

Dear Diary,
<p>
Today is 24 May 2020, and there are 5,417,853 new cases of COVID. I have been counting for 124 days and I am feeling angry. If today's count is 5,417,853, what will tomorrow bring? How can we survive this? What will I see in the news, if I live to the morrow?
<p>
How many will die, of the 5,417,853 people who got COVID today? How many will give COVID to others, and to how many others?
<p>
If I tell my friends that 5,417,853 more people got COVID today, will they go out less? Will they wear a mask? Will they lie awake, staring at their ceiling?
<p>
How many hours of sleep are lost? How many days of work? How many dollars, or pounds, or euros? How many lives are lost and how many hearts break? Who sits alone in the silence? Who sheds tears and who feels an eternal nothing, a closing down not of their own volition?
<p>
When do we stop, Diary? Where does this lead us?
<p>
When will I stop?
<p>

Dear Diary,
<p>
Today is 13 June 2020, and there are 7,789,270 new cases of COVID. I have been counting for 144 days and I am feeling shattered. If today's count is 7,789,270, what will tomorrow bring? How can we survive this? What will I see in the news, if I live to the morrow?
<p>
How many will die, of the 7,789,270 people who got COVID today? How many will give COVID to others, and to how many others?
<p>
If I tell my friends that 7,789,270 more people got COVID today, will they go out less? Will they wear a mask? Will they lie awake, staring at their ceiling?
<p>
How many hours of sleep are lost? How many days of work? How many dollars, or pounds, or euros? How many lives are lost and how many hearts break? Who sits alone in the silence? Who sheds tears and who feels an eternal nothing, a closing down not of their own volition?
<p>
When do we stop, Diary? Where does this lead us?
<p>
When will I stop?
<p>

Dear Diary,
<p>
Today is 03 July 2020, and there are 11,075,391 new cases of COVID. I have been counting for 164 days and I am feeling alone. If today's count is 11,075,391, what will tomorrow bring? How can we survive this? What will I see in the news, if I live to the morrow?
<p>
How many will die, of the 11,075,391 people who got COVID today? How many will give COVID to others, and to how many others?
<p>
If I tell my friends that 11,075,391 more people got COVID today, will they go out less? Will they wear a mask? Will they lie awake, staring at their ceiling?
<p>
How many hours of sleep are lost? How many days of work? How many dollars, or pounds, or euros? How many lives are lost and how many hearts break? Who sits alone in the silence? Who sheds tears and who feels an eternal nothing, a closing down not of their own volition?
<p>
When do we stop, Diary? Where does this lead us?
<p>
When will I stop?
<p>

Dear Diary,

Today is 12 August 2020, and there are 20,615,100 new cases of COVID. I have been counting for 204 days and I am feeling insane. If today's count is 20,615,100, what will tomorrow bring? How can we survive this? What will I see in the news, if I live to the morrow?
<p>
How many will die, of the 20,615,100 people who got COVID today? How many will give COVID to others, and to how many others?
<p>
If I tell my friends that 20,615,100 more people got COVID today, will they go out less? Will they wear a mask? Will they lie awake, staring at their ceiling?
<p>
How many hours of sleep are lost? How many days of work? How many dollars, or pounds, or euros? How many lives are lost and how many hearts break? Who sits alone in the silence? Who sheds tears and who feels an eternal nothing, a closing down not of their own volition?
<p>
When do we stop, Diary? Where does this lead us?
<p>
When will I stop?
